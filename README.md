# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
This repository aims to show what a requirement analysis is all about in the world of software engineering. What it the importance of such a document and who is concerned by it.

# What is Requirement Analysis?
What is Requirement Analysis? It is a crucial process in software engineering that aims to define, understand, and document a software or system need with all the stakeholders. This process will later help analyze the project and also define the needed timeline.

# Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
## 1. It helps to gather all the information on a project.
## 2. Reduce risks
## 3. clear documentation
## 4. Make communication easy
## 5. Facilitate test
## 6. Helps to prioritize tasks
## 7. Accept changes and make them easy

# Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.
  + Requirement gathering: The purpose of this requirement is to brainstorm and come up with a general possible functionality that the software or system can have.
        This is done by collecting information from stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations.
  + Requirement elicitation: working session with stakeholders, to uncover hidden or implicit requirements.  
  + Requirement documentation: Formal recording of requirements in a clear and structured format. This is done by using a user story, use cases, and diagrams
  + Requirement analysis and modeling: The process of analyzing requirements to cover any inconsistencies, conflicts, or gaps.
  + Requirement validation: a process to ensure that the documented requirement clearly reflects the stakeholder needs.

# Types of Requirements:
  ## Functional requirement:
      This defines the system behavior, what the system must have. It focuses on the user and their interaction with the system.
      + user authentication. 
      + user searching 
      + user can book
      + Data processing from the request to the server through the load balancer
  ## Non-functional requirement:
      This defines how the system will perform and its reaction to change.
      + The number of users the booking app can handle at a time without crashing
      + The security level of the app
      + The system architecture used(Micro services) to make changes easy and maintenance.
      
  ## Use Case Diagrams.
      This is a UML Diagram helping to visually represent the interaction between a user and the system to perform a specific task.
      This diagram is important because it facilitates the understanding of the interaction between the user and the system. Using this, everybody can understand the 
      different user types the system can have, and the actions that each can perform.
